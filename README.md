# BlazorTwitchBotExample
A simple example of using Blazor Web Assembly to create a Twitch Bot! And by simple, I mean this isn't inundated with architecture for the sake of having archtiecture. I put this together to show people how they can use Blazor Web Assembly (WASM) and an ASP.NET back-end with SignalR to write a functioning bot for Twitch. It will connect, listen to chat, and echo it out to the front-end Index.razor file.
